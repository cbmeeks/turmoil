Turmoil clone

Here's my take on Turmoil from the 2600.  I became interested when I realized how unfair it was that the 2600 has 64 colors vs 15 colors on the TI, and multicolor sprites too.  But then I discovered an elegant way to do multicolor sprites in bitmap mode, and just had to see if it would be fast enough.  The game is written in C, and compiled with GCC for the TI.  I also used Tursi's Convert9918 program to generate the dithered colors on the rainbow screen.

Gameplay requires Joystick 1.  Press fire to start.  Use joystick to move and press fire to shoot.  Holding down the fire button while moving is an effective way to eliminate swaths of enemies.  Collect the blinking prize before it explodes for 800 points, but get out of there quick when the saucer comes.  Shoot the arrows before they turn into formidable tanks. An extra ship is awarded at the completion of each level.
